## ðŸ“‚ Projects

### 1. [PJI Consultancy: Driving Data-Driven Customer Insights](#)
- **Objective**: Optimized database queries and develop insights to help businesses better understand and engage their shoppers through data-driven analysis.
- **Key Tools**: MySQL, Python and Tableau
In a world where businesses strive to understand their customers better, PJI Consultancy Squad embarked on a mission to unlock the hidden potential of data for Walmart, a global retail leader. Our project, built around the Customer Personality Analysis dataset, was more than just a technical exerciseâ€”it was a journey to redefine how businesses approach customer segmentation, targeted marketing, and decision-making.
Please refer to my Project report: [View My Project Report](https://github.com/Payal-kumari1/payalkumari.github.io/blob/main/PJI%20Consultancy.pdf)

The heart of our project lay in analyzing marketing campaigns. By examining response rates to various promotions, we identified trends that Walmart could leverage to optimize its marketing spend. High-income customers, for instance, were more likely to engage with premium campaigns, while frequent shoppers responded best to loyalty programs. We presented these insights with interactive dashboards, enabling Walmartâ€™s marketing team to explore campaign performance in real time.

The project culminated in actionable recommendations. We proposed personalized strategies, such as targeting high-value customers with exclusive offers and using predictive models to time campaigns with customer buying cycles. Our database design ensured these strategies were grounded in reliable and scalable data structures, facilitating future analyses and decision-making.

### 2. [Optimizing Portfolio Returns: A Data-Driven Approach with Fama-French and Momentum](#)
This project integrates the Fama-French Five Factor Model with the Momentum factor to develop a data-driven investment strategy for stock selection and portfolio optimization. Using historical S&P 500 data, we employed regression analysis and backtesting to evaluate the impact of factors such as market risk, size, value, profitability, and momentum on stock returns. A custom Brandeis Score was created to rank stocks, combining factor weights, alpha, and RMSE to identify undervalued and overrated stocks. The results demonstrated a consistently superior portfolio performance compared to the S&P 500 benchmark, providing actionable insights for long and short positions to optimize returns.
