# Hi, I'm Payal Kumari! üëã

üåü **Data-Driven Storyteller | Business Analyst | Aspiring Data Scientist**

Hello! I'm Payal Kumari, a passionate advocate for the power of data to shape decisions and drive success. Currently pursuing my Master‚Äôs in Business Analytics at Brandeis International Business School, I specialize in transforming raw data into compelling narratives that inform strategic business moves.

With a robust background in project management and hands-on experience as a Business Analyst at MCB Bank, I led innovative projects that propelled digital transformation, including the launch of a digital banking platform that increased online transactions by 30%. My analytical toolkit is filled with Python, R, and SQL, which I use to unearth insights that enhance customer engagement and optimize processes.

I thrive on challenges and am always eager to learn. Whether it's developing customer segmentation strategies that boost marketing effectiveness or creating stunning data visualizations, I approach each task with creativity and a keen eye for detail. 

Beyond my professional pursuits, I am deeply committed to giving back through volunteer work, focusing on health awareness and community empowerment. I believe in the importance of using my skills for social good.

Let‚Äôs connect! I‚Äôm excited to collaborate on projects that harness the transformative power of data to create impactful solutions.
